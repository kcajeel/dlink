# D-Link DCS-930L Vulnerability Project
For this project, I used research from the internet to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a D-Link DCS-930L camera. The camera has many known vulnerabilities, 
so this was a fun project to do. The powerpoint presentation details my process from start to finish and I have included all of the screenshots I took as well as the 
scripts I wrote to help exploit the camera.
